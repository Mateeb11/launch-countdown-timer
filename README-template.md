## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS modules
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - preprocessor scripting language for css
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - local development server

### Why with React

Beacuse maybe in the future the app needs to add others pages, add functnalties, in thats case it will be easier to do it with a library that can handle complex problems easier than vanila javascript.
